A very basic and rudimentary terminal project made with C#, made to replicate an ATM system with manually-set and randomized accounts.

The programs' Account Object is publically accessible, since it wasn't stated as an explicit requirement in the project. In practical, non-educational use, I would have made it fully private for proper encapsulation.
